In this section, we
will explore one of the most popular Arb
strategies: Index Arbitrage. The original exchange traded funds or ETFs were created to mirror the most heavily
traded indexes: the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and the Dow 30. As volume of these
ETFs increased and passive investing
became more popular, the number of ETFs increased to more than 6,000 worldwide by 2018 of which 3,500
were equity-based. ETFs currently manage over
$5 trillion of assets and are traded actively by both institutional
and retail traders. Index Arbitrage is a
high-frequency strategy. Indexes are composed of multiple
stocks or bonds each of which is traded separately
or as part of an index ETF. Traders need to know
the current bid, offer, and size of orders
for each index component, and also the weighting of each component in each
index in order to know exactly what price they can buy and sell the
index in the market. They then compare that with
the best bid and offer for the index ETF and see if there's an arbitrage opportunity. For example, you
could buy shares of all 100 components
of the Nasdaq 100 in exactly the right
proportions and then sell shares of the QQQ ETF. This may seem like a lot of
effort for a small profit, but it's the main business of lead market-makers for the
QQQ who are constantly converting mirror
portfolios into QQQ shares and then converting QQQ shares into their component's stocks. Index Arbitrage also has high-infrastructure
costs due to its need for real-time market data feeds, high-speed computers, and co-location with
exchange servers. Co-location reduces the time between when your order
execution program receives market data and the exchange receives
your trading orders. This is called reducing
data and execution latency.
