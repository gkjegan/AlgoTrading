In this section, we
will talk briefly about the different parts
of the quant universe. Quantitative trading is a family of analytical methods and execution strategies that
comprise the quant universe. Quantitative trading is gradually taking over the world and now counts for almost 90 percent of trading volume overall. I began my trading career about 20 years ago in a proprietary trading group
within a global bank. The group traded
options, forwards, and futures based on foreign exchange rates
and interest rates. It was separate from
the bank's risk management function which use the same derivatives
but only to hedge the risk and the bank's lending
and investment portfolio. Initially, it was my
responsibility to create pricing and risk management models
within the trading group. My primary focus was
to create a model of the behavior volatility in exchange rates and
short-term interest rates. A successful quantitative
strategy depends on good quality
data which you can analyze statistically to uncover potentially profitable
patterns and behaviors. Algorithmic trading is a type
of quant trading that uses pre-specified machine
executable instructions to determine the size
and timing of trades based on a quantitative model of an asset's price behavior. Over 70 percent of US trading
volume is algorithmic. Most of this volume is high-frequency trading
which we will discuss next. High-frequency trading is
a subset of algo trading, focuses on the rapid execution of short term trading strategies at the millisecond and
sub-millisecond timescale. We base or high-frequency
trading strategies on quant models and market
micro-structure features such as liquidity and latency
which we will talk about in a later section covering
arbitrage strategies.
