In this section,
we will see how to use one of Google Cloud's
most popular tools called BigQuery and this latest
edition the machine learning ML to make predictions
of the future. You know that building ML models can be very time-intensive. You must first export
small amounts of data from BigQuery into Pandas
and then Datalab, you then transform the data
to be used in TensorFlow. You build a model in TensorFlow and train
it locally on a VM. Doing that with the small model then requires that
you go back and get more data to create new features and
improve performance. Doing this repeatedly is hard. So you stop after
a few iterations. BigQuery ML enables users
to create and execute machine learning
models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries. BigQuery ML democratizes
machine learning by enabling SQL
practitioners to build models using existing
SQL tools and skills. BigQuery ML increases
development speed by eliminating the
need to move data. Let's see in the next
slide how it does that. In four major steps,
it looks like this. In step 1, you create a SQL query to extract
training data from BigQuery. In step 2, you create a model specifying model
type also within BigQuery. Three, you evaluate your model and verify that it meets
your requirements. Finally in step 4, you predict using that model on data extracted from BigQuery. Voila, you have now completed your first model in BigQuery
using four simple steps. If you are explaining
BigQuery ML to others, I often just lists
these main points. To recap, BigQuery
ML allows you to; one, write machine learning
models with SQL; two, experiment and
iterate right where your data lives in BigQuery; three, build classification, binary and multi-class
and forecasting models; four, know machine learning? Inspect model weights and
adjust hyperparameters too.
