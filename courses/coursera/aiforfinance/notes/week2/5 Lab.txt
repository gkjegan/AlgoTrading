In this lab, we will be creating regression model
using Big Query Machine Learning. The objectives in the lab are to
teach you about the following. First, we need to understand
the model objective. Predict stock prices of Apple five days
into the future using past values. So in this lab, we are going to learn one, how to import data into Big Query, two,
how to add some features to the data. Three, how to build a model
using Big Query ML, and four, how to evaluate the results.
